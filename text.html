                free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br> weeks was
                the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            <p class="para6">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some
                structure from professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged
                to<br> enroll by a former student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program.
                The entire <br>curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had
                to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team project, <br>in particular, was outstanding. <br>It took
                my learning to the next level in<br> a way that no tutorial could ever<br> have. In fact, I’ve often
                referred to it<br> during interviews as an example of <br>my developent experience. It<br> certainly
                helped me land a job as a <br>full-stack developer after receiving<br> multiple offers. 100% recommend!.
